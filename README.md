## Description
In this project, I will be acting as a data scientist working for an electric car-sharing service company.

I will be processing the stations' data to understand electric car usage over time by solving the following research
question.

Research Question:

* Identify the most popular hour of the day for picking up a shared electric car (Bluecar) in the city of Paris over the month  of April 2018}
* What is the most popular hour for returning cars?
* What station is the most popular? At the most popular picking hour?
* What postal code is the most popular for picking up Blue cars? Does the most popular station belong to that postal code? At the most popular picking hour?
* Do the results change if you consider Utilib and Utilib 1.4 instead of Blue cars? 
## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Google Colab/Jupyter Notebook.

* Pandas and Numpy Python libraries for data exploration and manipulation

* Data cleaning tools

* Exploratory data analysis techniques.

## Known Bugs
